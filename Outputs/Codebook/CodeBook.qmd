# Overview #
This codebook is designed to inform the coding process for my Torrential Twitter trial study. Prior to coding Tweets, the raw data sets were initially cleaned using the statistical programming software R [@r], utilizing functions from `Janitor` [@rJanitor]. Tweets will then be coded using an application designed with Shiny [@shiny] to determine the severity of harassment and type of account. 

Severity of Harassment includes:

- Positive

- Neutral

- Name-calling

- Gender-based insults

- Vicious language

- Credible Threats

- Hate Speech


Type of account includes:

- Personal

- Professional

- Bots

- Spammers

- Anonymous 

- Suspended/Deleted

# Coding Schedule #
## Severity of Harassment ##
The coding of sentiment in Tweets will be conducted to determine the severity of harassment, measuring Tweets on a seven-point scale ranging from positive to hate speech [@mantilla2013], [@silencingwomen]. The sentiment categories will be mutually exclusive, therefore only one of the seven types of harassment can be selected per reply [@krippendorff]. The seven-point scale contains the following categories, and they are: 

(@) **Positive**
a. XXX

| Tweet                                                                                                             | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @ ElizabethMay @ paulmanly The forefront of the climate revolution. They're pushing big on Vancouver Island and for good reason!   |

(@) **Neutral**
a. A neutral Tweet states a fact without expressing an opinion. Reference @tbl-neutral-example for an example.

| Tweet                                               |                                                              
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| @ Laurel_BC The gov't declared a climate emergency. |  

: Sample of a **neutral** Tweet sent to MP Laurel Collins {#tbl-neutral-example}

(@)	**Name-calling** 

a. “Comments the receiver perceives as unpleasant” [@silencingwomen, p. 248]. For an example, see @tbl-name_calling-example. 

| Tweet                                                                                                    |

(@) **Gender-based insults**

a. Derogatory comments and terms used against women, including “whore” and “slut” which are “…designed to insult and humiliate women, especially in regard to their weight and physical appearance” [@mantilla2013, p. 564]. See @tbl-gender_insult-example for an example. 

| Tweet                                                                                                           |

(@)	**Vicious language** 
a.	Vile and violent descriptions of behaviour that gendertrolls claim that they would like to subject the female user to [@mantilla2013] [@Citron]. @tbl-viciouslang-example emphasizes an example.

(@)	**Credible Threats** 
a.	Doxxing, stalking, and threats of rape and death [@mediatingmisogyny]
b.	Tangible “threats of sexual violence “literally, albeit not physically, penetrate” women’s bodies”” [@Citron, p. 17].

(@) **Hate speech** 
a.	Hateful comments which oppose freedom of speech, violate human rights, and may even be unlawful [@silencingwomen] [@chettyalathur]

c.	Online or offline vilification of an individual communicated in a specific context based on “… race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, [or] disability” (Government of Canada, 2021).

| Tweet                                                            |

## Type of Account ##
Only one type of account can be selected and will also be coded mutually exclusively. If one user replies to a single Tweet by a female politician using multiple separate Tweets, then each Tweet will be coded separately. There will be no limit on the coding of the number of replies sent by an individual account. 

Types of accounts include and are defined as:

(@) **Personal**
a.	People who represent their own views and interests and use their account for fun, to read the news, and socially interact [@uddin, p. 2]

(@) **Professional**
a.	Share information about their area of expertise and may include businesses who use the platform to market their products and reach new audiences [@uddin, p. 2]

(@)	**Bots**
a.	Automated “… online agents that are used to intervene in political discourse online” and are intentionally created to circulate disinformation, malicious content, and flood the notifications of users [@Duboisbots, p. 28], [@marlow].

(@) **Spammers**
a.	Intentionally “spread malicious content” [@singh, p. 2].
b.	May show up as one individual who has created multiple accounts to bolster their ability to send harassing content (Mantilla, 2015).

(@)	**Anonymous** 
a.	An individually intentionally hiding information about their identity and location for the purposes of using the platform maliciously. May include not adding a profile picture or using an obscured, random picture and not revealing their actual name, age, gender, and other identifying characteristics [@trifiro].
b.	Hide behind fake usernames and “… express sexist, racist, or homophobic views with little fear of being held accountable for their comments” [@wagner, p. 8]. 

(@)	**Suspended/Deleted** 
a. Accounts found to be in violation of Twitter's Terms of Services and temporarily or permanently removed from the platform. 

# Other Guidelines
## Retweets ##
Retweets are not to be coded, only responses to Tweets that are initiated from the accounts of one of the three female politicians. A simple retweet or quote Tweet (retweet with comment) would not count, as the Tweet being shared was not originally authored by one of female politicians.

## Threaded Responses ##
Threaded responses occur when one user posts a connected series of Tweets which contribute towards building the same message or narrative. They may be numbered as 1, 2, 3, … out of the total number of responses.

For the purposes of this study, each Tweet in a threaded response will be analyzed and coded as a separate Tweet authored by one of the accounts in the study. 

## Media ##
Twitter defines any gifs, memes, images, and videos as media [@Twittermedia]. Media embedded in Tweets should be considered as part of the written text of the Tweet and coded accordingly, given that hateful speech can also be expressed through images and symbols [@carlson]. With increasing doctoring and creation of media for the purpose of deception and political gain, any media embedded in Tweets should be analyzed for manipulation and machine-learning generated deepfakes, which are compelling fake pictures and videos [@farid], [@appel]. 

For Tweets that contain a picture without additional text, the nature, context, and suggestiveness of the picture will be analysed to determine the severity of harassment [@sagemethods]. Emojis, if included in a Tweet, will be interpreted as both a picture and text, analysing the rest of the Tweet for context [@swartz]. Moreover, hashtags will be coded in the same manner as regular text in Tweets [@sagemethods]. 

## Hate Speech ##
It is anticipated that quantity of hate speech detected in this sample of Tweets will be quite low, given that these Tweets are from 2019 when Canadian politics was slightly less polarized on Twitter and Twitter employed their content moderation rules more frequently. However, given changes to Canadian politics and the affordances of Twitter, this is likely to change in the full-scale version of this study.
